# Hello Markdown!

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list
  
   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to align the raw Markdown).

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.
